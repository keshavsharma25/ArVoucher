ArVoucher represents a pioneering initiative designed to facilitate the seamless distribution of Arweave tokens, trying to eliminate the necessity to request an individual's specific wallet address. This solution tries to address a significant requirement within the Arweave ecosystem. Arweave, renowned for providing an enduring platform for data storage in exchange for Arweave tokens, often presents challenges for newcomers in acquiring these tokens. ArVoucher attempts to solve this issue with traditional vouchers. Instead of the conventional approach of soliciting wallet addresses, contributors can effortlessly generate vouchers. These vouchers can then be directly handed over to those seeking tokens, streamlining the process and bolstering accessibility for all participants.

## How it Works?

This is the flow of how the vouchers are created in the backend. The sponsorer has the authority to create, cancel, and claim the voucher themselves as well.
Whereas, the redeemer can only withdraw until the voucher expires, else only the owner can withdraw from the voucher.

**Note**:

Due to the late execution of the idea as it took a significant time to figure out the Arweave ecosystem. The main issue was to figure out the Atomic Asset Standard, as our use case really aligned with the standards. We are looking forward to completing this project even after the completion of the hackathon as we think that this can really help the ecosystem for the public good.
